        "Crowd-based requirements engineering (CrowdRE) involves large scale user participation in RE related tasks. In order to extract meaningful insights, supervised machine learning techniques (SML) have been used in the literature for the classification of crowd-based software requirements. These techniques involve training ML models which requires a lot of time, computational resources and high quality labeled data which is extremely rare to obtain in the context of CrowdRE. We focus on the problem of classifying crowd-based software requirements using unsupervised ML techniques. Our approach involves generating sentence embeddings, evaluating them using information retrieval (IR) measures and applying clustering algorithms on the best performing sentence embeddings. In the last step, we apply topic modeling using BERTopic followed by the manual labeling of clusters. We also provide the option of automated labeling of these clusters using the idea of semantic similarity. We have applied our approach to a large-sized dataset with around 3000 crowd-generated requirements for smart home applications. We have experimented with both binary and multi-class classification problems, e.g., tertiary, quaternary and quinary classification. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach can be very useful for the classification of crowd-based software requirements in the absence of labeled data. Additionally, our approach can also be used to analyse and identify labeling related issues in the dataset which may be useful for improving the quality of existing ground truth data.",

        "The consequences of a healthcare data breach can be devastating for the patients, providers, and payers. The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.",
